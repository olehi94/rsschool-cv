### About me
I've been working for EPAM about 3 years as a SAP CDC(Customer Data Cloud) engineer/consultant.\
Throughout my projects I've been touching Javascript but not use it on a high level. \
The main point of this course is to gain Frontend/Javascript skills.\
Since SAP CDC is well integrated using API, WEB SDK, Server Side SDKs, Mobile SDKs, etc... I believe it will help to feel confident during the design/architecture phase.
